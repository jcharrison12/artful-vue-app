# Artful, an Art Gallery App Frontend

Artful is a art curation app with a frontend in Vue.js using Bootstrap. This application contains a collection of Images which Users can add to their personal Galleries, along with a journal note about the piece of art and a checkbox whether they have seen the art in person. Users can view other users' galleries to see what other people are thinking about Starry Night, for example.

I have deployed the backend to Heroku with the frontend deployed to Netlify. You can see the whole app in action [here](https://artful-app.netlify.app/).
